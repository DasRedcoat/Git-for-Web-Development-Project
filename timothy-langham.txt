     - git push -u origin "timothy-langham" (or whatever you have named your branch)
    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
       - you go to the file you wish to work on in GitHub. You fork it to your own repositories. go to your repositories and copy the http clone address. Open GitBash and go to the file you wish to clone it to. In this case it is desktop/lambda/unit1/w1d2/NameofProject once you are in that file by checking with "cd" you type into the command "git clone WebAddress". this will clone it to your file foolder. After that DONT FORGET to cd INTO the new file by typing "cd filename" to go into it. 

Once you are in the file using GitBash, you want to "checkout" your version, to be able to edit it. type "checkout -b timothy-langham" to create the branch. Then open it using "code ." to edit and work. Once you are done, SAVE YOUR WORK using Ctrl+S, you then "add" your changes to the saved file using the command "git add ." - this will update the file and make it ready to commit. to commit you type 
  git commit -m "message" (in the " is where you leave your version notes ") 

Finally, you push it back to the github server using (git push -u origin timothy-langham) - NOTE That the file name is not in quotes for the final step. 


Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
   - block elements take effect over the max allowed space on a page. from border to border. A paragraph (p) is a block element. and it will stretch side-to-side unless otherwise contained by a border. An in-line element on the other hand, will effect just the line it is added to in the code, such as making a line of text bold or inserting an image onto a line. if you want an image to display between lines above and below it. you need to center it with a margin value, and add line breaks <br> above and below it. 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
   - When an element is positioned absoolutely, it disregardes the other CSS code being read, and will absolutely, put it in the spot you intend. Such as a photograph next to a paragraph or centering an image for a background.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? Set it inside a box and give it a margin: auto???

    4. Name 3 elements that diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is displayed inline-block by default
  - Block - Headings, paragraphs, and divisions. In-line elements are spans, images and anchors. and buttons are an in-line block display be default

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    - Give the Margins and a center:auto; element.
